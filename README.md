# Android Architecture NewsApp Sample
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://github.com/AkshayChordiya//blob/master/LICENSE)

During Google I/O 2017, Android Team announced [guidelines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html) for architecture of Android app.
This is just sample app explaining the new Architecture Guidelines written in **Kotlin**, YAY!

## Components Demonstrated
- [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle.html)(Used by LiveData)
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html)
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html)

## What's the app about?
It's an extremely simple app which uses [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to show the latest news from Google News.
It uses [Retrofit 2](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to fetch the news from the API and save them into database using [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html).
The main aim of this sample app is show how to use the new [Architecture Guidelines](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html) with Kotlin.

## Steps to run:
- Go to [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and generate an API key (It's only 2 steps!)
- Put the API key at the bottom of the `gradle.properties`
`
NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
`
- Run the app
- Enjoyyyyy ðŸŽ‰

## Architecture

The app uses `ViewModel` to abstract the data from UI and `Repository` as single source of truth for data. `Repository` fetch the data from database if it doesn't exist then it fetches from the webservice.

## Learn Architecture Components
Trying to learn the new Architecture Components. I have wrote a series of articles to understand Android Architecture Components. Feel free to check it out to learn more.

## Todo
- ~~Write article explaining the complete flow of application~~
- Create fork of repo showing integration with Dagger 2
- Write test cases; (DONE for Room - DAO and Retrofit - WebService)

## Testing
The architecture components are highly testable. Following table shows how to test various parts of the app (cheatsheet for testing architecture component)

|  Component |     Test     |        Mock        |
|:----------:|:------------:|:------------------:|
|     UI     |   Espresso   |      ViewModel     |
|  ViewModel |     JUnit    |     Repository     |
| Repository |     JUnit    | DAO and WebService |
|     DAO    | Instrumented |          -         |
| WebService | Instrumented |    MockWebServer   |
